plotly_data(p)

# When a data frame is associated with a plotly object, it allows us to manipulate the data underlying that object in the same way we would directly manipulate the data. Currently, plot_ly() borrows semantics from and provides special plotly methods for generic functions in the dplyr and tidyr packages. Most importantly, plot_ly() recognizes and preserves groupings created with dplyrâ€™s group_by() function.

# add a line highlighting houston
add_lines(
  # plots one line per city since p knows city is a grouping variable
  add_lines(p, alpha = 0.2, name = "Texan Cities", hoverinfo = "none"),
  name = "Houston", data = filter(txhousing, city == "Houston")
)
